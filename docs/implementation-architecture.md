# Orthodox Vault Implementation Architecture

This document captures the implementation-oriented architecture decisions for the vault builder.

`Orthodox-Vault-Goals.md` remains the north-star document focused on purpose, principles, and major decisions.
This file records the detailed "how" for extractor, model, and renderer design.

## Core Decision

The project should use:

- source-specific extractors/adapters
- one shared normalized domain model
- shared rendering primitives with a small number of rendering profiles

It should **not** use:

- one giant extractor that tries to parse every source type with one code path
- fully separate end-to-end renderer and output schema per source

## Why This Hybrid Model

The inputs are structurally different:

- OSB is structured EPUB with multiple note families and linked auxiliary files
- Lexham is structured EPUB with chapter anchors and linked footnotes
- EOB is PDF text extraction with page-layout cleanup concerns
- NET is PDF apparatus-first, not primarily a reading-text source
- Greek sources are expected to be repository/database exports rather than page-layout documents
- Fathers and Philokalia often behave more like distributed note corpora than chapter-by-chapter Bible layers

Because of this:

- extraction must be source-aware
- output contracts should still stay normalized and shared

## Architecture Shape (Implemented)

The project uses **Ports & Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)** with a DDD domain core. All layers are now implemented and tested.

### Domain Layer (`vault_builder/domain/`)

**Value objects (frozen dataclasses)** — immutable after construction:
- `Verse(number, text)`
- `VerseRef(book, chapter, verse)` — canonical citation reference
- `StudyNote(verse_number, ref_str, content, verse_end?, anchor_id?)`
- `StudyArticle(title, content)`
- `BookIntro(book, source, content)`, `ChapterIntro`, `PartIntro`

**Aggregates (mutable dataclasses)** — mutation via methods only:
- `Chapter(book, number, verses, pericopes, after_markers)`
  - `add_verse(number, text)` → raises `DuplicateVerseError` on collision
  - `sorted_verses()` → ordered list
- `Book(name)`
  - `chapters` → read-only `MappingProxyType` (direct write raises `TypeError`)
  - `add_chapter(chapter)` → raises `DuplicateChapterError` on collision
  - `max_chapter()` → int
- `ChapterNotes(book, chapter, source, ...)`
  - `add_note(NoteType, StudyNote)` → routes to correct list
  - `add_article(StudyArticle)`
  - `sorted_notes(NoteType)` → verse-ordered list

**`NoteType` enum** — all note routing uses typed enum, never bare strings:
`FOOTNOTE`, `VARIANT`, `CROSS_REF`, `LITURGICAL`, `CITATION`, `TRANSLATOR`, `ALTERNATIVE`, `BACKGROUND`, `PARALLEL`

**Domain exceptions** (`vault_builder/domain/exceptions.py`):
`VaultDomainError` (base), `DuplicateVerseError`, `DuplicateChapterError`, `UnknownBookError`, `MissingSourceError`

### Ports Layer (`vault_builder/ports/`)

Abstract base classes that adapters must implement:

- `ScriptureSource`: `read_text() → Iterator[Book]`, `read_notes() → Iterator[ChapterNotes]`, `read_intros() → Iterator[BookIntro]`
- `VaultRenderer`: `render_hub()`, `render_text_companion()`, `render_notes()`, `render_book_intro()`
- `VaultWriter`: `write_hub()`, `write_text_companion()`, `write_notes()`, `write_book_intro()` — all return `Path`

### Source Adapters (`vault_builder/adapters/sources/`)

Implemented adapters:

| Short name | Class | Mode |
|-----------|-------|------|
| `osb` | `OsbEpubSource` | HUB |
| `lexham` | `LexhamEpubSource` | COMPANION |
| `eob` | `EobEpubSource` | COMPANION |
| `greek_lxx` | `GreekLxxCsvSource` | COMPANION |
| `greek_nt` | `GoArchGreekNtSource` | COMPANION (custom interface) |
| `net` | net_epub/net_pdf | COMPANION (custom pipeline) |
| `apostolic_fathers` | `ApostolicFathersEpubSource` | COMPANION (custom renderer) |

### Service Layer (`vault_builder/service_layer/extraction.py`)

`ExtractionService` orchestrates the full pipeline:

```
source.read_intros()  → renderer.render_book_intro() → writer.write_book_intro()
source.read_text()    → renderer.render_hub() (HUB mode)
                        renderer.render_text_companion() (COMPANION mode)
                        → writer.write_hub() / write_text_companion()
source.read_notes()   → renderer.render_notes() → writer.write_notes()
```

Returns `ExtractionResult` with counts and `summary()` string.

`ExtractionMode.HUB` — used by OSB; produces hub files.
`ExtractionMode.COMPANION` — used by Lexham, EOB, Greek LXX; produces text companion files.

### Composition Root (`vault_builder/bootstrap.py`)

`bootstrap(source_name, *, output_dir, full_run, source=None, renderer=None, writer=None) → ExtractionService`

- Wires all dependencies from a single source short-name
- Per-source `SAMPLE_CHAPTERS` config lives in `_SOURCE_CONFIG`
- `source=`, `renderer=`, `writer=` overrides enable test injection without real EPUB/PDF

### Output Adapters (`vault_builder/adapters/obsidian/`)

- `ObsidianRenderer(VaultRenderer)` — pure functional Markdown renderer
- `ObsidianWriter(VaultWriter)` — writes files to disk following vault folder conventions

### Test Fakes (`tests/fakes.py`)

- `FakeScriptureSource(ScriptureSource)` — in-memory source from plain Python lists
- `FakeVaultWriter(VaultWriter)` — captures write calls in dicts; never touches disk

### Source Provenance vs Normalized Meaning

All adapters map source-specific note markers to `NoteType`:

- OSB: `crossReference.html` → `CROSS_REF`; `studyNote` → `FOOTNOTE`; patristic citations → `CITATION`
- NET: `tn` → `TRANSLATOR`; `tc` → `VARIANT`; `sn` → `FOOTNOTE`; `map` → `BACKGROUND`
- Lexham: translator notes → `TRANSLATOR`; variants → `VARIANT`
- EOB: variants → `VARIANT`; alternatives → `ALTERNATIVE`; citations → `CITATION`

## Rendering Model

`ObsidianRenderer` implements two rendering paths:

### Hub Renderer (`render_hub`)

- Canonical frontmatter (`testament`, `genre`, `book_id`, `aliases`, `up`, `prev`, `next`)
- Mode navigation callout with all companions linked
- H6 verse anchors with inline verse numbers (`.vn` span) + hidden `^vN` block IDs
- One real verse per anchor — no grouped-verse corruption

### Chapter Text Companion Renderer (`render_text_companion`)

Used for EOB NT, Lexham OT, Greek LXX, Greek NT. Scoped nav (hub + own notes + NET Notes).

### Notes Companion Renderer (`render_notes`)

Used for OSB Notes, NET Notes, Lexham Notes, EOB Notes. Verse/pericope-ordered headings with typed callout blocks.

### Book Intro Renderer (`render_book_intro`)

Used by OSB. Linked from Chapter 1 `intro:` frontmatter field.

## Phase 1 Notes Policy For New Source Layers

Not every source note system needs first-class rendering in the same phase as text extraction.

- `Lexham OT`: chapter companion remains text-first in Phase 1. The extractor should parse or skip linked footnotes deliberately, but the rendered reading file should not leak inline note sigla or orphan links. A later `Lexham Notes` artifact remains optional.
- `EOB NT`: chapter companion remains text-first in Phase 1. Numeric footnote markers and supplementary essays should be stripped from the reading file unless a later dedicated EOB note layer is intentionally added.
- `NET`: chapter companion is notes-first by design. Here the apparatus is the product, so note typing and verse-context rendering are part of the primary contract.

Shared rule:

- text-first companions should privilege readability and stable verse anchors
- note apparatus that is deferred should be deferred cleanly, not half-rendered
- validator expectations must reflect the chosen strategy per source

## Shared Navigation Contract

Most generated files should share the same top-of-file mode navigation shape so the vault feels like one system rather than a set of isolated exports.

### Canonical Nav Order — DECIDED (2026-03-23)

| Slot | NT | OT | Purpose |
|------|----|----|---------|
| 1 | OSB | OSB | Orthodox primary (hub) |
| 2 | EOB | Lexham | Orthodox comparison text |
| 3 | RSV | RSV | Classic ecumenical text |
| 4 | Greek NT | LXX | Original language |
| 5 | NET Notes | NET Notes | Technical apparatus (universal) |
| 6 | EOB Notes | Lexham Notes | Source-specific notes |
| 7 | Study Notes | Study Notes | OSB study notes |

**NET text companion** is not included in the nav. It exists on disk but is accessed via an inline link within NET Notes files only. This reflects NET's notes-first purpose — the text is a support artifact for the apparatus, not a reading mode.

**RSV Notes** is a planned slot (parallel to EOB Notes / Lexham Notes) once RSV extraction quality is resolved.

### Hub vs. Companion Nav Scoping — DECIDED (2026-03-23)

**Hub nav is comprehensive** — links to all mode companions and all notes companions. The hub is the navigation home; discoverability is the priority.

**Companion navs are scoped** — each companion links only to:
1. The hub (back link)
2. Its own notes companion (if applicable)
3. NET Notes (universal apparatus — always present)

This keeps companion navs to 2–3 items. Notes companions link back to the hub and include NET Notes; they do not link to each other.

### Book Intros — DECIDED (2026-03-23)

- Book intro files (e.g. `Matthew — OSB Intro.md`) are linked from the **book index file** via the standard navigation.
- Chapter 1 hub files also include an `intro:` frontmatter field pointing to the intro file when one exists for that source (e.g. `intro: "[[Matthew — OSB Intro]]"`). This field is **only on chapter 1** — not repeated on every chapter hub.
- All other chapter hubs omit the `intro:` field.

### General Principles

- keep label order stable and consistent with the canonical order above
- allow source-specific omissions when a layer does not exist for that chapter or source
- keep OT-only additions (Lexham, LXX) conditional rather than universal
- samples must be regenerated whenever the renderer nav logic changes; stale companion navs are a known failure mode

This should be validated as a shared output contract, not as a source-specific implementation detail.

## Validation Expectations

Validation should test shared output contracts, not source internals only.

Shared validation concerns:

- hub frontmatter and path policy
- verse-anchor continuity and order
- companion/hub link integrity
- verse-order rendering for note layers
- malformed range detection
- source-to-output structural correctness

Source-specific extraction can vary internally as long as it emits valid normalized output.

## Planning Rule

When adding a new source:

1. decide whether it is chapter-bound or distributed
2. define its adapter
3. map its source-specific structures into the shared normalized model
4. choose an existing rendering profile if possible
5. add a new rendering profile only if the source genuinely needs one
